# DG_robotic_automation
This is a robotic automation for industrial use designed with PIC16F877A and pcb circuit designed with PROTEUS 8.

The input signals from limit switches passes through optocouplers (4n35) to microcontroller in order to read the position of the brackets and the output signals energizes 5V relays which drive the solenoid valves for the robot movements. The output signals are buffered (with ULN2823).
